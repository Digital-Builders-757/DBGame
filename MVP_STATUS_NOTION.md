## 🎯 **THE PIVOT: Event Portal + Builder Card**

**We're not building "a cool future game" anymore — we're building the thing you actually need this month to run your world.**

### **The Law: Social Rule of the House**

> "If you want to attend Digital Builders events, pitch, or get funds… you must make a Builder account."

That one rule makes this MVP powerful even before you add any fancy game systems.

## 🎯 **Immediate Next Steps**

### **Priority 1: Events Portal**
1. ✅ Build `/events` list (server component) pulling `events` (RLS-safe).
2. 🔄 Build `/events/[slug]` detail; include RSVP/Cancel actions (tickets insert/delete).
3. 🔄 Redirect after login → `/events`.

### **Priority 2: Check-In System**
1. `/admin/check-in`: search by email/name for a specific `event_id`.
2. Action: set `tickets.status = 'checked_in'` + `checked_in_at = now()`.
3. Guard by `role = 'admin'`.

### **Priority 3: Builder Card**
1. `/builder-card`: query `builder_cards` view (or profiles + xp sum fallback).
2. Show name/handle, region, XP total, level (fake), last event attended, badges (manual).

### **Priority 4: Cleanups / Hardening**
1. Remove temporary `eslint.ignoreDuringBuilds` and `typescript.ignoreBuildErrors` once code is clean.
2. Keep Next.js 15.5.7 / React 19.2.1 (patched CVE-2025-66478).
3. Verify Resend domain/DNS; use `lib/email/resend.ts` with `EMAIL_FROM=admin@digitalbuilders757.com`.
4. Ensure Supabase pages/actions run on Node runtime (avoid Edge warnings with supabase-js).

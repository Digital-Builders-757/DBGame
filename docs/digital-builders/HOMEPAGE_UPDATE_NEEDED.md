# ⚠️ Homepage Needs Complete Rewrite

**Date:** December 2025  
**Status:** Partial Cleanup Done - Full Rewrite Needed

---

## ✅ Fixed

- ✅ Removed `PostGigFooterLink` component import
- ✅ Updated hero text to Digital Builders
- ✅ Updated footer copyright
- ✅ Fixed broken links (`/choose-role` → `/signup`)

---

## ⚠️ Still Needs Update

The homepage (`app/page.tsx`) still contains many TOTL-specific references:

- "500+ Verified Talent" stats
- "Featured Talent" section
- "Browse Talent" buttons
- TOTL-specific copy throughout
- Links to `/talent` route (doesn't exist)

---

## 🎯 Recommended Action

**Option 1: Quick Fix (Minimal)**
- Remove/comment out TOTL sections
- Add placeholder Digital Builders content
- Fix broken links

**Option 2: Complete Rewrite (Recommended)**
- Create new Digital Builders homepage
- Show game features, character creation, dashboard preview
- Use brand colors and typography
- Remove all TOTL references

---

**Current Status:** Homepage will have errors until fully updated for Digital Builders.
